This is my Rust implementation for the ["Build Your Own Build your own Interpreter" Challenge](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/interpreter/overview).

This challenge follows the book
[Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) by Robert Nystrom.

In this challenge you'll build an interpreter for
[Lox](https://craftinginterpreters.com/the-lox-language.html), a simple
scripting language. Along the way, you'll learn about tokenization, ASTs,
tree-walk interpreters and more.
